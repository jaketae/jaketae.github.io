:wave: Hi, Iâ€™m Jake (Jaesung) Tae. I recently graduated from Yale University with a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at [Optiver](https://optiver.com/) building high frequency trading systems.

While I no longer actively maintain this blog, I hope you still find some interesting bits to read. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed writing.
