    "# Bayesian regression with linear basis function models\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is an introduction to Bayesian regression with linear basis function models. After a short overview of the relevant mathematical results and their intuition, Bayesian linear regression is implemented from scratch with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) followed by an example how [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) can be used to obtain equivalent results. It is assumed that you already have a basic understanding probability distributions and [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem). For a detailed mathematical coverage I recommend reading chapter 3 of [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (PRML) but this is not necessary for following this article.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Linear regression models share the property of being linear in their parameters but not necessarily in their input variables. Using non-linear basis functions of input variables, linear models are able model arbitrary non-linearities from input variables to targets. Polynomial regression is such an example and will be demonstrated later. A linear regression model $y(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w})$ can therefore be defined more generally as\n",

    "where $\\phi_j$ are basis functions and $M$ is the total number of parameters $w_j$ including the bias term $w_0$. Here, we use the convention $\\phi_0(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$. The simplest form of linear regression models are also linear functions of their input variables i.e. the set of basis functions in this case is the identity $\\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$. The target variable $t$ of an observation $\\mathbf{x}$ is given by a deterministic function $y(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w})$ plus additive random noise $\\epsilon$. \n",

Maximum likelihood estimation can lead to severe over-fitting if complex models (e.g. polynomial regression models of high order) are fit to datasets of limited size. A common approach to prevent over-fitting is to add a regularization term to the error function.

The highest evidence is usually obtained for models of intermediate complexity i.e. for models whose complexity is just high enough for explaining the data sufficiently well. "

The `fit` and `predict` methods of this estimator are on the same abstraction level as our `fit` and `posterior_predictive` functions.
