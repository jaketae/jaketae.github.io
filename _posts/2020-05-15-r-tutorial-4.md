This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk
or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or
by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output
will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press
*Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the
editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code
chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the
editor is displayed.
